The main information in the SIEM are : The source IP, the time and the name of the attack/vulnerability.
First of all, I search for the shellshock attack on google on a certified URL(for example www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr) and evaluate the risk severity for the organisation to determinate the delay to remediate or at least mitigate the risk. In order to take proper action, I get the recommandation in the editor documentation. As soon as possible if the risk is high, I apply the recommended patch.
In parrallel, I search in an internal tool if I know the IP. If not, I block it on the firewall. I also notify everyone involved in the project that a suspicious behaviour has been detected.
