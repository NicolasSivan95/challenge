I search for the shellshock attack on google (www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr) and evaluate the risk for the organisation to determinate the delay to remediate.
First of all, I search in an internal tool if I know this IP. If not, I block it on the firewall. I also notify everyone involved in the project that a suspicious behaviour has been detected
I get the recommandation in the editor documentation. As soon as possible if the risk is high, I apply the recommended patch
